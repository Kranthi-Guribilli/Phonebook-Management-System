## About Phonebook Management System ðŸš€ :
<p> Phonebook is a very simple mini project in C which can boosts our confidence and will help us as a reference project to functions, file handling and data structures. This application can get our hands in experience.</p>
<p> Adding new records, listing them, modifying them and updating, search for contacts saved, and deleting the phonebook records are the basic functions which make up the main menu of this Phonebook application.</p>
<p> Personal information such as name, phone number,citizenship, email and etc., are asked while adding record into the Phonebook. These records can then modified, listed, searched for and removed.</p>
<p> I've used many functions in this mini project. These functions are easy to understand as their name itself signifies their respective operations.
